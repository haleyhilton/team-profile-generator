  ## Description
This is a command line input application that takes in information from the user and generates an HTML file with all input team profile information. 

Options for selection include "Engineer", "Intern" and "Manager" which inherits classes from "Employee" - as well as adds further input contingent upon the role selected. Once all information is entered, an index.html file is generated with Bootstrap styling. 

Further updates will include validation for all information given to ensure accuracy.
